# Version control with `git` and *GitHub* 

We are interested here in the solutions offered by *RStudio* and *GitHub* for hosting and version control of projects. This allows to monitor changes history, to help collaborative development and to facilitate continuous integration.

## Principles of version control

The principle of version control is to record the successive changes made to files (especially `.R` files in our case).

*RStudio* offers 2 integrated solutions for version control:

  - `git`
  
  - `svn` ("subversion")




### `git`

`git` is a version control software (i.e. a tool that will record the history of successive changes to your code and allow you to share these changes with other people). `git` is a command line program, and it is not necessarily very intuitive to use. 

`git` works as follows: on a remote server (e.g. in the cloud), an **updated** version of the code is available. At any time it is possible to access this version of the code online. Each contributor can download this last **updated** version (in an action called *pull*), before editing it locally. Once changes are made locally, the contributor can then update the online version of the code, so that his changes become available to everyone (in an action called *push*).

**NB:** `git` was designed for lightweight files (such as text files) and is far from being optimized for heavy and/or compressed files (e.g. `.RData` files).

### `subversion`

`subversion` is the other solution available in *RStudio*. It works in a similar way to git, but with less features that we won't detail here (the major difference is that all contributors work simultaneously on the same version of the code).




## Use `git` locally within *RStudio*

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !***  
> 
> 1. Start by enabling `git` from the "*Git/SVN*" tab of "*Project Options*" located in the "Tools" menu and follow the instructions. You can also run `usethis::use_git()` in the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` console alternatively.
> 
> 2. From the "*Git*" tab that now appears next to the "*Build*" tab, register the current state of your package by making your first commit:
> 
>     - 2a. Select the files to track (do not select the `.Rproj` file)
>     - 2b. write an informative message (for your collaborators -- this includes your future self)
>     - 2c. click on "Commit"
>     - 2d. if this is the first time you are using git on your computer, you might be prompted with an error that looks something like that:
>       ```
>       *** Please tell me who you are.
>       
>       Run
>       
>       git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
>       git config --global user.name "Your Name"
>       ```
>       To solve this, run the following command into the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` console with **your user.name** and **your email** filled in: `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "FirstName LastName", user.email = "your@email.com")`
> 
> 3. Add a "*.Rproj" line to the ".gitignore" file and make a new commit
> 
> 4. Visualize the changes and their history using the visualization tools "Diff" and "History" tools accessible from the "Git" tab

### Good *commit* practices

Ideally, each commit should solve only one problem. It should fix it in its entirety (be **complete**), and contain only changes related to that very problem (be **minimal**). It is especially useful to write **informative** commit messages (be kind and help your collaborators, which includes your **future self**). You should also be concise, and describe the reasons for the changes rather than the the changes themselves (visible in the *Diff*).  
**NB:** it is sometimes difficult to follow these guidelines to the letter, and they are merely an ideal guide. They certainly should not prevent you from should from regularly making *commits*. 

On the other hand, the temptation to have a *"clean" and tidy* change-history is natural, but it is a source of unnecessary problems. It contradicts the traceability goal of version control. Since code development is generally a complex, messy, and non-linear intellectual process, it is normal that the recording of changes reflects this path. In practice, your future self will be the first user of your change history, so the priority is to make it easier for you in the future when solving bugs or extending functionality.

## *GitHub*

[*GitHub*](https://github.com/) is a website offering an online code hosting solution, and is based on `git`. There are many alternative websites and services ([*GitLab*](https://about.gitlab.com/), [*Bitbucket*](https://bitbucket.org/), ...) allowing to host code and also based on `git`. *GitHub* is very popular in the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` community, and is relatively easy to use, even for a novice user.

**Advantages** of using *GitHub*:
 
  - a simple and user-friendly graphical interface to track the history of changes to your code
  
  - the latest development version of your code is available online and you can reference it (you can even reference a specific commit number to freeze a specific version of the code)
  
  - users have a clear and transparent channel to report bugs/difficulties
  
  - it greatly facilitates collaborative development
  
  
### Upload one's package `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` onto *GitHub*

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !***
>
> 1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and create a *GitHub* account (if you hesitate, a common convention is to use your *firstnamelastname* as username)
> 2. Follow the instruction from [chapters 9 and 10 in *Happy Git With R* by Jenny Brian ](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro) to store your *GitHub* authentication within *RStudio*. The general advice is to use. 
>     - `https` and a *Private Access Token* with `usethis::create_github_token()` if on `Windows` or `MacOS` [`r emoji::emoji("globe_with_meridians")` *chapter 9*](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat)
>     - to use `ssh` with a *pair of private and public keys* if on `Linux` [`r emoji::emoji("globe_with_meridians")` *chapter 10*](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys)
> 2. Then run `usethis::use_github()` into the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` console and follow the instructions.
> 3. Add a `README.Rmd` file to your package in order to have a nice home page on *GitHub*:
>    - 3a. In *RStudio*, run the command `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`
>    - 3b. using the "*Diff*" tool in the "*Git*" tab of *RStudio*, review the changes made by the previous command
>    - 3c. edit the created `README.Rmd` file, then create the corresponding `README.md`  file by running `knitr` (click on the wool ball "*Knit*" at the top left in *RStudio*), before making a 3^rd^ commit containing these changes
>    - 3d. At this point, if you visit your directory page on *GitHub*, your 3^rd^ commit does not appear for the moment. You have to synchronize the online *GitHub* directory with your local folder. To do this, you have to click on "*Push*" from the "Git" tab. Now, the changes of this 3^rd^ commit should be visible online on *GitHub.*
      
    
    

## Collaborative code production

![Artwork CC-BY Allison Horst](endeavR_files/github_friends.png){width=100%}



`git` and GitHub are particularly useful and efficient when several people collaborate to develop code together. Indeed, everyone can *pull* and *push* successive changes to the code, simultaneously, while endusing to always be working on the latest version of the code. We will see different concepts useful in the case of such a collaborative work.

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !*** 
>
1. By pairing-up with another participant, you will each add your new buddy as a "collaborator" to your GitHub directory from the **"Settings" tab on GitHub**.
>
  2. A few moments later, the added collaborator receives an email inviting him to accept the addition (check your spam folder). Click on the link and accept.
>
  3. In *RStudio*, create a new project form `git` using the `https` url of your buddy's project.
   
### *Branches*

A useful features of `git` is *branches*. This allows you to make important changes in the changes in the code without disrupting the current operation. It is particularly useful to explore a development path that you don't know if it will be successful in the end.

By the way, you have already been using branches since the beginning of this part. Indeed, the default branch is called "*main*" (or sometimes "*master*").

Thanks to this system of branches, we obtain a tree of the different *commits* over time (where the nodes correspond to the separation of the branches).


### *Merge*
  
A so-called "*pull*" can be decomposed into 2 actions made by `git`: 
  
  1. first a *fetch*, which corresponds to downloading the online code
  
  2. immediately followed by a *merge*, which merges the local version with the downloaded changes.
  
After conducting experimental development in one branch one may want to *merge* these changes into the "master" branch for example, once the experiment has proved successful.
  
If the changes concern separate parts of the code, then *merging* can be done without any problem. On the other hand, if the two versions to be *merged* both contain changes which concern the **same lines of code** since their last **common** *commit* , then we will encounter one (or more) **conflicts**, which we will have to be manually resolved.
  

### Conflicts

Let's take the following example: the developer $D_1$ and the developer $D_2$ have both *pulled* the version v0.1 of the code at time $t$ on their respective machines. They each work independently to make changes to the code. When *pushing* his/her changes, developer $D_2$ receives an error message: 

`"Sync Error.`  
`Please resolve all conflicted files, commit, then try syncing again."`

Each file that is a source of conflicts has then been automatically edited with:
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
<<<<<<< HEAD
local code
=======
online code
>>>>>>> remote
```

In order to solve the conflict, you have to manually and carefully edit each file one by one, choosing whether to keep the local or the online version of the code, before you can *commit* again, and finally successfully *push* your changes online.

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !*** 
> 
> 1. Edit the `README.Rmd` file of your paired buddy, then *commit* your change, and finally *push* them.
> 2. Once your buddy has modified your own `README.Rmd` modify the file on the same line (make sure by discussing it together), **WITHOUT** *pulling* your buddy's changes first! *Commit* and try to *push* these changes.
> 3. Resolve the conflict.

**NB:** In real life you want to avoid this situation and always *pull* before *pushing*, here we purposely do the opposite for the sake of providing an example and demystifying conflicts.


### *Fork*

A *fork* allows you to create a copy of your own from an available code repository. Thus the original code will not be impacted by your changes. This is like creating a branch, and severing it from the tree, so you can assume ownership of it. It could also have been called a "cutting" to continue the metaphor...

This action is mainly useful for *pull requests* (see next).



### *Pull request*

*Pull requests* are the easiest way to propose changes in a code project which you are not a contributor of. GitHub provides a graphical interface that makes this easy to do so.

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !*** 
>
  1. Modify the `README.Rmd` of your neighbor who is **NOT** your paired-buddy after *forking* his package.
>
  2. Propose your change in the form of a *pull request* from their GitHub repository webpage ("Pull request"s tab).
>
  3. Accept your own neighbor *pull request* on your repository GitHub website, and then *merge* it.



### *Issues*

For any GitHub repository, you can post a comment, in the form of an *issue*, to alert the developers about a possible bug (providing a minimally reproducible example of the bug), or a question about the use of the package, or ask for an additional feature...

Ideally, you should propose a *pull request* that solves your *issue* when you can (i.e. when you have both the ability and time).

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !*** 
>
>  1. Use `usethis::use_github_links()` to add the following 2 lines to your package `DESCRIPTION` file:  
> `URL: http://github.com/*username*/mypkg`  
> `BugReports: http://github.com/*username*/mypkg/issues`
>
>  2. View the new changes, then *commit* them.
>
>  3. Create an *issue* on your paired buddy's project
  
  
  

## Continuous Integration (CI)

With each change, with each *commit*, there is the possibility to introduce 1 (or more) bugs that will prevent the package from passing the *CRAN* `R CMD CHECK`. If you accumulate too many of these bugs, at the time of submitting the new version to *CRAN* there could be many corrections to make. It is even more frustrating if the package passed the `R CMD CHECK` before... 

Continuous integration services allow you to *check* and test your package **automatically** after each *commit* ! In case of failure, you will receive an email informing you. A number of these services offer a (limited) free package for open-source projects. 

Another reason to use continuous integration is that it allows you to test your package on different infrastructures than yours (e.g. Windows, Ubuntu, Mac OS) and for different versions of `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` (*current*, *devel*...)

### *GitHub Actions*

*GitHub Actions* let you launch "actions" automatically, every time you push to GitHub. The `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")` command allows you to initialize *Github Actions* to add the `R CMD CHECK` action to your package.

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !***
>
>  1. Run the command `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")`, then *commit* and *push* the changes. See what happens on the GitHub webpage under the "Actions" tab.
>
>  2. Add a badge to your README.Rmd (do not forget to `knit` it) with the code obtained in the console and *commit* (and *push*) those changes.


Have a look at the following webpage which informs about the different *GitHub Actions* available for `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` packages: [https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/README.md](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/README.md)


## Build and deploy a companion website for one's package

`pkgdown` is an `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` package that automatically generate a nice website gathering the documentation about your package (including *Vignettes*).

> ***`r emoji::emoji("point_right")` Your turn !***
> 
> 1. Run `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()` into the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` console.
>
> 2. *Commit* & *push* the changes. Go to your *GitHub* *Actions* tab and see what is new.

> ***`r emoji::emoji("point_right")` Your turn !***
> 
> Examine the different changes to `DESCRIPTION` sfollowing the various `usethis::use_...` run previously.
> 
> If needed, modify the *URL* field from the `DESCRIPTION` file.

## Appendix 2.1: R-hub {-}

The *R consortium* provides the [R-hub builder](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2016/06/06/first-public-version-of-the-r-hub-builder), and has the ambition to one day provide a continuous integration service especially dedicated to `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` packages.

It has the advantage to use the exact same infrastructure as the `CRAN` make the *check* of your package foolproof. You can use it through the `devtools::check_rhub()` function.


## Appendix 2.2: Code coverage {-}

The `covr` package proposes a solution to measure the coverage of unit tests associated to a package. The test coverage determines the proportion of the source code that is actually used during the execution of unit tests. Measuring the coverage of the code reinforces the reliability of a code and gives more confidence to its potential users.

> `r emoji::emoji("point_right")` ***Your turn !*** 
>
> 1. Run the command `use_github_action("test-coverage")` to trigger *GitHub Actions* to compute the coverage of your package.
> 2. *Commit* and *push* these changes.

For more information feel free to look at the [`covr` package](). To be able to display your coverage rate on your README, run the command `usethis::use_coverage()` in the `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and add a nice badge with the code you got in the R console.  
**NB:** for this new badge to display properly, you need to log into the [codecov.io](https://app.codecov.io) website and follow the instructions for enabling your repository to upload its coverage results through *GitHub Actions* (requires some advanced interactions with *GitHub Actions*).

  - Hadley Wickham's online books are truly excellent and contain a lot of supplementary information to what we have covered in this training:
  
    - the website on writing packages [*R packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/).
    
    - the website [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) for everything regarding optimization, `Rcpp`, or parallel computing.
    
    - the website [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is also quite comprehensive and includes chapters on data management in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`, but also on  structures in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`, modeling, as well as elements on graphics and `Quarto`.
    
  - The online book [Rcpp for everyone](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/) by Masaki E. Tsuda is also very good.
